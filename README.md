# Analysis of Heatmap Images: Unsupervised Learning Tasks
This work is for a project in TTT23. Group: Kim Duyen Le, Laura Fe√∏y Ven, Live Standal Myklebust and Malin Rekdal

## What is in this repositorium 
 
Code that uses unsupervised learning to analyze 33 images of mice with tumors. The goal is to extract meaningful features from the images. 

The images are added in the rawdata folder, and displays heatmaps representing the bioluminescence signal intensity resulting
from an injection of mammary carcinoma cells fraction enriched with extracellular vesicles.
